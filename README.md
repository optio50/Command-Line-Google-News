# Command-Line-Google-News
Get Top 10 Google News Headlines With Clickable Links

I modified this script from hemanth because his included url shortener (https://is.gd) banned my VPN service.
The modification is the use of the tinyurl module and defaulting the news to U.S. headlines.

This is a python script that will install (with PIP) the required dependicies if not alreay installed.
If your terminal supports mouse clicking then you can click the tinyurl link that will open your default browser
to read more than just the newsflash headline.

You can edit the script (uncomment) to display other types of headlines and other countries other than U.S

Required Packages
feedparser tinyurl colorama
